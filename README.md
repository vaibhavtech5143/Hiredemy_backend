### Optimizations Implemented:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Implemented validation for the required fields (`name`, `mobile`, `email`, `salary`, `city`, `country`, `department`, `role`) before creating an assistant record. This ensures that the incoming data is validated before processing.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Implemented error handling for database connection errors, database initialization errors, and table creation errors. This ensures that errors are caught and logged appropriately, preventing unexpected crashes and providing better feedback to developers.

3. **Database Connection Pooling**:
   - Implemented a connection pool for managing database connections, which helps improve performance and scalability by efficiently reusing connections.

4. **Database Initialization**:
   - The application checks if the specified database exists and creates it if not. This ensures that the database is properly initialized before performing any operations.

5. **Table Creation**:
   - Implemented table creation logic to create the `assistants` table if it doesn't exist. This ensures that the required table structure is in place for storing assistant records.
